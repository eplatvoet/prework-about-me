      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Erin. I recently decided to make a big change for myself, and pursue a new career path. Coding brings me back to the good old days of Myspace, and I'm excited to be able to develop my skills and myself throughout this program.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>All over, in a sense! I was born in NJ, and spent a few years in PA. I usually say I grew up in California (Bay Area) since I spent the ages of 10-18 there, but I told my parents as we boarded our first flight to CA "I will be back on the east cost". I was right, & ended up at Seton Hall Univsersity, then relocated to MA for 6 years shortly after graduating. My husband and I got married in 2018, and knew we wanted to come back to NJ, and withing a year, we were back in the great state of New Jersey.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love going to the beach, binging on some of my favorite TV shows, watching college basketball, and traveling. I have a goal of seeing all 50 states before the age of 50, and I'm almost at 30 states so far!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job that I love going to every day. I want to be challenged, and be able to track my achievements and successes. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently reside in Keasbey, New Jersey</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be able to see my hard work pay off, and have results to prove it. I've always been interested in technology, teaching myself HTML in high school. </p>
